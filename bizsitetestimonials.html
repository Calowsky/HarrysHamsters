<p> Boris Bergeron, owner of Boris's Buffet of Brighton says that one of the reasons
 people always come back to his restuarant is because of the classic hamster taste 
 in his soups that everyone is always ranting and raving about. According to Boris, 
people have come from as far as Newton Massachusetts to try his famous hamster soup.
 Boris says that he uses Hamster for soups because boiling them in water is the only 
way to unlock that famous hamster flavor.  </p>

<p> Sally Serpentine, owner and founder of Sally's Sausages, credits Harry's Hamsters
 as the ingredient that saved her company. Sally's Sausages, located in Somerville, 
 was once one of the most popular restuarants in town. However, in the mid 2000's  
 the keto diet started getting more and more popular, and no one wanted to get  
 a sausage without a bun. Her business started drying up, and she was months  
 behind on rent. However, when she put hamster-werst on her menu the entire sitation
turned around over night. Just two weeks after putting hamster in her sausages, 
Sally had lines down the block of hungry customers, eagerly awaiting her now-famous 
snack. </p>
